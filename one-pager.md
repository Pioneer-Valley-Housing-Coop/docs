# Pioneer Valley Housing Co-op Seeks Property 

Are you interested in housing that fosters community, equity, sustainability, and stewardship for generations to come? What about a local alternative to renting and traditional homeownership? We are forming a group equity housing co-op to collectively invest in ourselves, our community, and the environment.

**Community** We aim to support resident and comunity wellbeing through designing spaces that balance independence and interdependence.

*Designed to supp*
* Multiple homes clustered around shared spaces and resources  
* Engagement with local community through public access spaces and events
* Room for creative projects and businesses

*For Residents:*
* Flexibility of renting
* Groundedness of traditional homeownership 
* Social life of cohousing

**Equity** We aim to be democratic and affordable by structuring as a group equity housing co-op. 
 
*Democratic*
* Housing co-op will own assets as a group, with residents as equal voting members
* Collective decision making and conflict mediation

*Affordable* 
* [Group equity](https://www.nasco.coop/development/handbook/equity) model will ensure low move in share, to be returned when they move out
* Initial funds will be raised from grants and community investors, not residents
* Residents will pay monthly costs to repay community investors

**Earth** We aim to live sustainably through community stewardship for a [just transition](https://movementgeneration.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/JT_booklet_English_SPREADs_web.pdf). 

*Sustainable*
* Net-zero buildings using passive solar 
* Member of renewable energy co-op
* Food sovreignty through regenerative agriculture 

*Stewardship*
* A community land trust will own the land permanently, and have a say in resale
* The housing co-op will own the buildings and lease the land from the land trust
* The land trust and other community stakeholders will be voting members of the co-op 

*Just*
* Housing and land should be decommodified and stewarded by and for the community, not speculative profits.
* Closed-loop, regenerative systems to support abundance and resilience away from an extractive economy.

**Ways to Support**
* We are looking for land access either by donation, agreement, or sale with the possibility of the landowner continuing occupancy. 
* We would love to connect with like-minded people and organizations
