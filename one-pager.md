# Pioneer Valley Housing Co-op Seeks Property 

Are you interested in housing that fosters community, equity, sustainability, and stewardship for generations to come? What about a local alternative to renting and traditional homeownership? We are forming a group equity housing co-op to collectively invest in ourselves, our community, and the environment.

**Community** We aim to support community and resident wellbeing through being democratic and affordable through our structure as a group equity housing co-op. 
 
*Community*
* Multiple homes clustered around common spaces and shared resources  
* Room for creative projects and enterprises
* Public access spaces and events

*Resident Wellbeing*
* Flexible commitment of renting
* Security and control of traditional homeownership
* Community of cohousing or ecovillage without inaccessibility

*Democratic*
* Housing co-op will own assets as a group, with residents as equal voting members
* Collective decision making and conflict mediation

*Affordable* 
* [Group equity](https://www.nasco.coop/development/handbook/equity) model will ensure low move in share, to be returned when they move out
* Initial funds will be raised from grants and community investors, not residents
* Residents will pay monthly costs to repay community investors

**Earth** We aim to live sustainably through community stewardship for a [just transition].(https://movementgeneration.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/JT_booklet_English_SPREADs_web.pdf) 

*Sustainable*
* Net-zero buildings using passive solar 
* Member of renewable energy co-op
* Food sovreignty through regenerative agriculture 

*Stewardship*
* A community land trust will own the land permanently, and have a say in resale
* The housing co-op will own the buildings and lease the land from the land trust
* The land trust and other community stakeholders will be voting members of the co-op 

*Just*
* Housing and land should be decommodified and stewarded by and for the community, not speculative profits.
* Closed-loop, regenerative systems to support abundance and resilience away from an extractive economy.

**Ways to Support**
* We are looking for land access either by donation, agreement, or sale with the possibility of the landowner continuing occupancy. 
* We would love to connect with like-minded people and organizations
* Link to website, survey, meetings, email
