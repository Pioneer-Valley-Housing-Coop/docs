# Pioneer Valley Housing Co-op Seeks Property 

Are you looking to do something unique with your land that fosters community, equity, sustainability, and stewardship for generations to come? We are a group of renters who live in the Pioneer Valley who have joined together as a group equity housing co-op. We are creating a local alternative to traditional homeownership where we can collectively invest in ourselves, our community, and the environment. 

We are looking for access to land either by donation, agreement or sale with the possibility of the landowner continuing occupancy. We would love to connect with like-minded people and organizations with the following values:

**Community**: We believe that resident wellbeing and community wellbeing is interdependent.
* Shared common house with multiple dwelling units for privacy
* Stability of homeownership with the flexible commitment of renting
* Public communal spaces including public orchards and gardens with [Help Yourself](http://commongreen.weebly.com/)
* Supportive of local enterprises and creative projects
* Collective decision making and conflict mediation with [Sociocracy For All](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/)

**Equity**: We believe housing is a right and should be affordable and democratically governed.
* Housing co-op will own assets as a group, with residents as equal voting members
* [Group equity](https://www.nasco.coop/development/handbook/equity) model will ensure low move in share, to be returned when they move out
* Initial funds will be raised from grants and community investors, not residents
* Sliding scale monthly costs will be reinvested in the property and used to pay off investors
* We are working with [Cooperative Development Institute](https://cdi.coop/) to legally incorporate

**Sustainability**: We believe in closed-loop, regenerative systems to support abundance and resilience as part of a [just transition away](https://movementgeneration.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/JT_booklet_English_SPREADs_web.pdf) from an extractive economy.
* Net-zero buildings with help from [Upper Valley Cottage and Cabin](https://www.instagram.com/uppervalleycc/) and [Vermod](https://vermodhomes.com/)
* Member of [Co-op Power](https://www.cooppower.coop/rays-the-valley), which develops community solar and creates local green jobs
* Food sovereignty through regenerative agriculture 

**Stewardship**: We believe land should be stewarded for the community, not speculative profits.
* A community land trust will own the land permanently, and have a say in resale
* The housing co-op will own the buildings and lease the land from the land trust
* The land trust and other community stakeholders will be voting members of the co-op 
* We are in conversation with [Mount Grace Land Conservation Trust](https://www.mountgrace.org/) to help find a property

Thank you so much for reading, we hope to hear from you!
