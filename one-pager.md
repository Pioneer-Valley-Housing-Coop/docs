# Pioneer Valley Housing Co-op Seeks Property 

Are you interested in housing that fosters community, equity, sustainability, and stewardship for generations to come? What about a local alternative to renting and traditional homeownership? We are forming a group equity housing co-op where we can collectively invest in ourselves, our community, and the environment.

**Community**: We believe that resident wellbeing and community wellbeing are interdependent.
* Multiple homes clustered around common spaces and shared resources  
* Engaged with local community through public access spaces and events
* Supportive of local enterprises and creative projects 
* Stability of homeownership with the flexible commitment of renting
* Collective decision making and conflict mediation

**Equity**: We believe housing is a right and should be affordable and democratically governed.
* Housing co-op will own assets as a group, with residents as equal voting members
* [Group equity](https://www.nasco.coop/development/handbook/equity) model will ensure low move in share, to be returned when they move out
* Initial funds will be raised from grants and community investors, not residents
* Residents will pay monthly costs to repay community investors

**Sustainability**: We believe in closed-loop, regenerative systems to support abundance and resilience as part of a [just transition away](https://movementgeneration.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/JT_booklet_English_SPREADs_web.pdf) from an extractive economy.
* Net-zero buildings using passive solar 
* Member of renewable energy co-op
* Food sovreignty egenerative agriculture 

**Stewardship**: We believe land should be stewarded for the community, not speculative profits.
* A community land trust will own the land permanently, and have a say in resale
* The housing co-op will own the buildings and lease the land from the land trust
* The land trust and other community stakeholders will be voting members of the co-op 
* We are in conversation with [Mount Grace Land Conservation Trust](https://www.mountgrace.org/) to help find a property

**Ways to Support**
* We are looking for access to land either by donation, agreement or sale with the possibility of the landowner continuing occupancy. 
* We would love to connect with like-minded people and organizations
* Link to survey
