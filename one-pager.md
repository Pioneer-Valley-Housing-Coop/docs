# Pioneer Valley Housing Co-op Seeks Property 

Are you interested in housing that fosters community, equity, sustainability, and stewardship for generations to come? What about a local alternative to renting and traditional homeownership? We are forming a group equity housing co-op to collectively invest in ourselves, our community, and the environment. Stability of homeownership with the flexible commitment of renting. We envision:

Values:

We believe in closed-loop, regenerative systems to support abundance and resilience as part of a [just transition away](https://movementgeneration.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/JT_booklet_English_SPREADs_web.pdf) from an extractive economy.
We believe that resident wellbeing and community wellbeing is interdependent.
We believe housing should be decommodified to be affordable and democratically governed.
We believe land should be stewarded for the community, not speculative profits.

(Optional) Community
* Multiple homes clustered around common spaces and shared resources  
* Room for creative projects and enterprises
* Engagement with local community through public access spaces and events

**Democratic** 
* Housing co-op will own assets as a group, with residents as equal voting members
* Collective decision making and conflict mediation

**Affordable** 
* [Group equity](https://www.nasco.coop/development/handbook/equity) model will ensure low move in share, to be returned when they move out
* Initial funds will be raised from grants and community investors, not residents
* Residents will pay monthly costs to repay community investors

**Sustainability**:
* Net-zero buildings using passive solar 
* Member of renewable energy co-op
* Food sovreignty through regenerative agriculture 

**Stewardship**: 
* A community land trust will own the land permanently, and have a say in resale
* The housing co-op will own the buildings and lease the land from the land trust
* The land trust and other community stakeholders will be voting members of the co-op 
* We are in conversation with [Mount Grace Land Conservation Trust](https://www.mountgrace.org/) to help find a property

**Ways to Support**
* We are looking for land access either by donation, agreement, or sale with the possibility of the landowner continuing occupancy. 
* We would love to connect with like-minded people and organizations
* Link to survey
