# Pioneer Valley Housing Co-op Seeks Property 

Are you interested in housing that fosters community, equity, sustainability, and stewardship for generations to come? What about a local alternative to renting and traditional homeownership? We are forming a group equity housing co-op to collectively invest in ourselves, our community, and the environment. We aim to create: 
* Multiple homes clustered around common spaces and shared resources  
* Room for creative projects and enterprises
* Engagement with local community through public access spaces and events

We seek an alterntive that provides:
* Flexible commitment of renting without losing money to landlord
* Stability and control of traditional homeownership without isolation
* Community of cohousing or ecovillage without financial inaccessibility or cultural conformity/ too intentional? 

We believe: 
* Housing should support wellbeing of residents, community, and broader local network. 
* Housing and land should be decommodified, to be stewarded by and for the community, not speculative profits.
* Closed-loop, regenerative systems to support abundance and resilience as part of a [just transition away](https://movementgeneration.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/JT_booklet_English_SPREADs_web.pdf) from an extractive economy.

**Democratic** 
* Housing co-op will own assets as a group, with residents as equal voting members
* Collective decision making and conflict mediation

**Affordable** 
* [Group equity](https://www.nasco.coop/development/handbook/equity) model will ensure low move in share, to be returned when they move out
* Initial funds will be raised from grants and community investors, not residents
* Residents will pay monthly costs to repay community investors

**Sustainability**:
* Net-zero buildings using passive solar 
* Member of renewable energy co-op
* Food sovreignty through regenerative agriculture 

**Stewardship**: 
* A community land trust will own the land permanently, and have a say in resale
* The housing co-op will own the buildings and lease the land from the land trust
* The land trust and other community stakeholders will be voting members of the co-op 
* We are in conversation with [Mount Grace Land Conservation Trust](https://www.mountgrace.org/) to help find a property

**Ways to Support**
* We are looking for land access either by donation, agreement, or sale with the possibility of the landowner continuing occupancy. 
* We would love to connect with like-minded people and organizations
* Link to survey
